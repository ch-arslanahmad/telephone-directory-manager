# telephone-directory-manager

Telephone directory will have 2 variables:
- name
- phone-number

It would have CRUD operations using STL classes:
- `map` - easy
- `set` - moderate

It also includes searching of records via area code as well.


## Reason

This is for practice purposes to get a deeper understanding of
- a program with restrictions
- using CRUD operations
- understanding STL `map`
- understanding STL `set` and using it with a value-pair like data-set.
